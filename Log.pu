I see the issue! Your MongoDB query logging shows:

```
Query: {'MIFMP.Bbi': {'$exists': True, '$ne': ''}}
```

But in MongoDB Compass, when you manually query:
```json
{"MIFMP.Bbi": {"$exists": true, "$ne": ""}}
```

It finds 179,713 documents!

## THE PROBLEM

Python's `True` (capital T) is being converted to the boolean `true` in MongoDB queries. The issue is likely that **PyMongo is being too strict** with the query or there's a subtle difference.

Looking more closely at your Compass query vs the code query, I notice in the debug logs:

```
Query: {'MIFMP.Bbi': {'$exists': True, '$ne': ''}}
```

But MongoDB needs **lowercase** `true`:
```
{'MIFMP.Bbi': {'$exists': true, '$ne': ''}}
```

Actually, PyMongo should handle this automatically... Let me look at the actual issue.

## ACTUAL ISSUE: Projection is Wrong!

Look at the debug log:
```
Projection: {'_id': 0}
```

The query is asking for `_id: 0` (don't return _id) but it's also asking for a field that doesn't exist in the projection!

The query should project the **payment ID field**, but it's only excluding `_id`.

---

## THE BUG in src/mongo_client.py

In the `find_one_with_field` method, look at this line:

```python
projection = {payment_id_field: 1, '_id': 0}
```

The debug log shows:
```
Projection: {'_id': 0}
```

This means `payment_id_field` is somehow not being included or is being set incorrectly!

---

## FIX: Debug the payment_id_field value

Add debug logging to see what `payment_id_field` is:

### **Update src/mongo_client.py - find_one_with_field method:**

```python
def find_one_with_field(self, field_name: str, payment_id_field: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Find ONE document that has the specified field with non-null value
    Used in Phase 2 to find payment IDs for uncovered attributes
    
    Args:
        field_name: MongoDB field name to search for
        payment_id_field: Payment ID field name to extract
    
    Returns:
        Payment ID if found, None otherwise
    """
    if self.collection is None:
        _log('error', "Not connected to MongoDB")
        return None
    
    try:
        # Clean array notation from field name
        cleaned_field = field_name.replace('[]', '')
        
        # DEBUG: Log input parameters
        _log('debug', f"Input parameters:")
        _log('debug', f"  field_name: {field_name}")
        _log('debug', f"  cleaned_field: {cleaned_field}")
        _log('debug', f"  payment_id_field: {payment_id_field}")
        
        # Build query
        query = {
            cleaned_field: {
                '$exists': True,
                '$ne': None,
                '$ne': ""
            }
        }
        
        # Project only payment ID field
        projection = {payment_id_field: 1, '_id': 0}
        
        # DEBUG: Log the query
        _log('debug', f"Searching for document with field: {cleaned_field}")
        _log('debug', f"  Collection: {self.collection_name}")
        _log('debug', f"  Query: {query}")
        _log('debug', f"  Projection: {projection}")
        _log('debug', f"  Limit: 1")
        
        # Execute query with limit 1
        document = self.collection.find_one(query, projection)
        
        # DEBUG: Log what was returned
        _log('debug', f"  MongoDB returned: {document}")
        
        if document:
            _log('debug', f"  Document keys: {list(document.keys())}")
            
            if payment_id_field in document:
                payment_id = document[payment_id_field]
                _log('debug', f"  ‚úì Result: Found payment ID = {payment_id}")
                return payment_id
            else:
                _log('debug', f"  ‚úó Result: Document found but payment_id_field '{payment_id_field}' not in document")
                return None
        else:
            _log('debug', f"  ‚úó Result: No document found")
            return None
        
    except Exception as e:
        _log('error', f"Error searching for field {field_name}: {str(e)}")
        import traceback
        _log('debug', traceback.format_exc())
        return None
```

## Also Check: What payment_id_field is being passed

In `src/main.py`, in the `run_phase_2` method, add debug:

```python
def run_phase_2(self):
    """Execute Phase 2: Find and test uncovered attributes"""
    self.logger.header("PHASE 2: Finding Records for Uncovered Attributes")
    
    # Get uncovered attributes
    uncovered_mappings = self.coverage_tracker.get_uncovered_mappings()
    
    if not uncovered_mappings:
        self.logger.info("All attributes covered in Phase 1! Phase 2 not needed.")
        return
    
    self.logger.info(f"{len(uncovered_mappings)} attributes not yet covered")
    self.logger.info("Searching for payment IDs with these attributes...\n")
    
    # Find payment IDs for uncovered attributes
    payment_ids_to_test: Set[str] = set()
    payment_id_field = self.test_config['paymentIdMapping']['mongoField']
    
    # DEBUG: Log what payment_id_field we're using
    self.logger.debug(f"Payment ID field from config: '{payment_id_field}'")
    
    self.logger.info("Querying MongoDB for uncovered attributes...")
    
    for idx, mapping in enumerate(uncovered_mappings, 1):
        mongo_field = mapping['mongoField']
        json_attr = mapping['jsonAttribute']
        
        self.logger.debug(f"[{idx}/{len(uncovered_mappings)}] {json_attr}")
        
        # Find payment ID with this field
        payment_id = self.mongo_client.find_one_with_field(mongo_field, payment_id_field)
        
        # ... rest of method
```

---

## RUN WITH DEBUG

```bash
python run_test.py --debug
```

Look for these lines in the output:
1. What is `payment_id_field` being set to?
2. What does `MongoDB returned:` show?
3. Is the projection correct?

Share the debug output and we'll see exactly what's wrong! üîç

The query itself is correct (it finds documents in Compass), so the issue is either:
- Wrong `payment_id_field` value
- Projection not working correctly
- Document returned but payment ID extraction failing
