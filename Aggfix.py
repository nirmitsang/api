Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. Your MongoDB has **nested objects**, not literal field names with dots.

The structure is:
```javascript
{
  "_id": "23809240000009301",
  "MIFMP": {
    "BlkIdr": "I",
    "DbAccNo": "20687774157699",
    "OutGngCrAmt": 100,
    "BtcMsgTp": "I",
    ...
  }
}
```

So the field path `MIFMP.DbAccNo` should work, but the selection logic isn't finding it because **after aggregation, the document structure might be getting modified**.

---

## The Real Problem: $project Stage Was Needed (But Done Wrong)

The issue is that without the `$project` stage, we're getting the full document including the `uncoveredFieldCount` field, and the helper function should work. But let me check the actual issue more carefully.

Looking at your mapping config from the earlier screenshot, the paths are correct:
- `mongoField: "MIFMP.DbAccNo"`
- This should access `record["MIFMP"]["DbAccNo"]`

The `_get_field_from_record` helper I provided should handle this.

## Let's Add Detailed Debug Logging

Update the `select_optimal_records` method in `src/aggregation_builder.py` to add comprehensive debugging:

### **Replace the `select_optimal_records` method:**

```python
def select_optimal_records(
    self,
    aggregation_results: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    uncovered_mappings: List[Dict[str, str]]

        uncovered_mappings: List of mapping dicts for uncovered fields
    
    Returns:
        Dict with selected payment IDs and coverage info
    """
    uncovered_fields = set(m['mongoField'] for m in uncovered_mappings)
    covered_fields: Set[str] = set()
    selected_records = []
    
    logger.debug(f"Selecting optimal records from {len(aggregation_results)} candidates")
    logger.debug(f"Total uncovered fields to find: {len(uncovered_fields)}")
    
    # DEBUG: Show structure of first record
    if len(aggregation_results) > 0:
        first_record = aggregation_results[0]
        logger.info("\nüîç DEBUG: Inspecting first candidate record structure...")
        logger.info(f"  Top-level keys: {list(first_record.keys())[:15]}")

        test_fields = list(uncovered_fields)[:3]
        logger.info(f"\n  Testing access to {len(test_fields)} sample uncovered fields:")
        for field in test_fields:
            value = self._get_field_from_record(first_record, field)
            if value is not None and value != "" and value != []:
                logger.success(f"    ‚úì {field}: {value}")
            else:
                logger.warn(f"    ‚úó {field}: {value} (empty or None)")
    
    # Now do the actual selection
    for idx, record in enumerate(aggregation_results):
        # Find which NEW fields this record would cover
        new_fields = []
        fields_checked = 0
        fields_found = 0
        
        for field in uncovered_fields:
            if field not in covered_fields:
                fields_checked += 1
                # Check if this record has data for this field
                value = self._get_field_from_record(record, field)
                
                if value is not None and value != "" and value != []:
                    new_fields.append(field)
                    fields_found += 1
        
        if idx < 3:  # Log first 3 records in detail
            logger.debug(f"\n  Record {idx}: Checked {fields_checked} fields, found {fields_found} with data")
        
        # If this record covers new fields, select it
        if new_fields:
            payment_id = self._get_field_from_record(record, self.payment_id_field)
            
            if payment_id:
                selected_records.append({
                    'paymentId': payment_id,
                    'coversFields': new_fields,
                    'totalUncoveredFields': record.get('uncoveredFieldCount', len(new_fields))
                })
                
                # Mark these fields as covered

                if idx < 3:  # Show which fields for first 3
                    logger.debug(f"    Fields: {new_fields[:5]}{'...' if len(new_fields) > 5 else ''}")
        
        # Stop if all fields covered
        if len(covered_fields) == len(uncovered_fields):
            logger.debug("  All uncovered fields now have coverage candidates")
            break
    
    still_uncovered = uncovered_fields - covered_fields

    if len(still_uncovered) > 0 and len(still_uncovered) <= 10:
        logger.info(f"  Uncovered fields: {list(still_uncovered)}")
    
    return {
        'selectedRecords': selected_records,
        'coveredCount': len(covered_fields),
        'stillUncoveredCount': len(still_uncovered),
        'stillUncoveredFields': list(still_uncovered)
    }
```

## Also Update the `_get_field_from_record` Method

Make sure it's robust:

```python
def _get_field_from_record(self, record: Dict[str, Any], field_path: str) -> Any:
    """
    Get field value from record, handling dot notation for nested objects
    
    Args:
        record: MongoDB record
        field_path: Field path (e.g., "MIFMP.DbAccNo")
    
    Returns:
        Field value or None
    """
    if not record or not field_path:
        return None
    
    # Split path into parts
    parts = field_path.split('.')
    current = record
    
    # Navigate through nested structure
    for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        if current is None:
            return None
        
        if isinstance(current, dict):
            if part in current:
                current = current[part]
            else:
                # Field not found at this level
                return None
        else:
            # Current is not a dict, can't navigate further
            return None
    
    return current
```

---

## Run Again and Check the Debug Output

```bash
python run_test.py
```

**Look for this section in the output:**

```
üîç DEBUG: Inspecting first candidate record structure...
  Top-level keys: ['_id', 'MIFMP', 'Msgerr', 'uncoveredFieldCount', ...]
  ‚úì MIFMP exists and is type: dict
  MIFMP sub-keys (first 10): ['BlkIdr', 'DbAccNo', 'OutGngCrAmt', ...]

  Testing access to 3 sample uncovered fields:
    ‚úì MIFMP.DbAccNo: 20687774157699
    ‚úì MIFMP.OutGngCrAmt: 100
    ‚úì MIFMP.BtcMsgTp: I

  Record 0: Checked 137 fields, found 45 with data
  ‚úì Selected 23809240000009301: covers 45 new fields
    Fields: ['MIFMP.DbAccNo', 'MIFMP.OutGngCrAmt', 'MIFMP.BtcMsgTp', ...]
```

---

## What the Debug Output Will Tell Us

1. **If it shows "‚úì MIFMP exists"** ‚Üí Structure is correct
2. **If it shows "‚úì MIFMP.DbAccNo: [value]"** ‚Üí Field access works
3. **If it shows "Record 0: Checked 137 fields, found 0 with data"** ‚Üí There's a mismatch between mapping field names and actual MongoDB field names

---

## Possible Issues We Might Find

### **Issue A: Field Names Don't Match**

If the debug shows:
```
‚úó MIFMP.DbAccNo: None (empty or None)
```

But you can see in Compass that `MIFMP.DbAccNo` exists, then the field name in your **mapping config** doesn't match the actual MongoDB field name.

**Solution:** Check the exact field names in your mapping config vs. what's in MongoDB (case-sensitive!).

---

### **Issue B: Fields Are Nested Deeper**

Maybe the structure is actually:
```javascript
{
  "someWrapper": {
    "MIFMP": {
      "DbAccNo": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Update mapping config paths.

---

### **Issue C: Aggregation Pipeline Changing Structure**

The aggregation might be modifying the document structure.

**Solution:** We'll see this in the debug output and can adjust the pipeline.

---

**Run it with the updated debug logging and share:**

1. What does the "üîç DEBUG: Inspecting first candidate record structure" section show?
2. Does it find "MIFMP exists"?
3. What do the test field access attempts show (‚úì or ‚úó)?
4. What does "Record 0: Checked X fields, found Y with data" show?

This will tell us exactly what's going wrong!
